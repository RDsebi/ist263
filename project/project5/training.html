            <h1>Half Marathon Training Plan</h1>
            <p>When training for a half marathon the most important thing is to get a training plan that fits your needs and goals. This training plan is what is going to help you build strength, endurance, and speed, keep you safe from injury and guiding you to the finish line. The main factors when choosing a training plan are:</p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>What are you trying to achieve with the half marathon. Are you trying to finish it in a decent pace or just finish the marathon? This plays a part in what training plan to choose.</p>
            <h2>Current Fitness Level</h2>
            <p>Depending on how fit you are as of right now your plan will depend. If you are someone who has never run before, your plan might be longer and start with shorter distances. If you are experienced in running, you might start a more rigorous training plan.</p>
            <h2>Scheduling</h2>
            <p>Remember the longer the distances the longer it is going to take to complete them. At the start, you might squeeze a run an hour before class as it might only take 30-45 minutes but longer distances might not fit in your schedule so plan ahead.</p>
            <p>I will provide some links of training plans that in my opinion are good and also the one I am using as of right now while training for my half marathon. Remember every person is different and that your fitness levels are not the same fitness levels as me.</p>
