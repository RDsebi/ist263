            <h1>Tips for running a Half-Marathon as a college student</h1>
            <p>Running a half marathon is no easy task. It takes endurance, discipline, and a lot of mental toughness to be able to complete. Add being a college student with many responsibilities and it is a hard task to manage and finding the motivation to keep going can sometimes be hard. Here are some tips to make this experience as smooth as possible, not easy but smoother:</p>

            <h2>Make a schedule</h2>
            <p>As a college student this is key for being able to train for a half marathon. This will help you stay on track and always be aware of what is coming up every day. Setting a schedule will not let you be surprised or doing randoms runs all the time. After having the perfect running plan setting the days you are running is key.</p>

            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>Being organized with how you track your runs is important to keep seeing improvement after every run. Set your pace and the distance you want to run and keep a log of it all the time.</p>

            <h2>Find a running partner</h2>
            <p>Having someone that runs with you is a great way to keep each other motivated in those days you do not want to go for a run. Having an accountability partner is always a good idea. If you cannot find one find groups online of people that are training for the same marathon.</p>

            <h2>Make time for rest</h2>
            <p>As much as running is the most important thing for running a marathon the second most important thing is taking rest days. Your body needs time to recover so you can run faster and longer distance.</p>

            <h2>Incorporate cross training</h2>
            <p>Cross training is basically working out but not running. This has to do with training your muscles and having strength so you can run more smoothly. You can go for a swim, bicycle, or just strength training would be enough. Try to do this at least 2 times per week apart from running.</p>

            <h2>Running in the mornings</h2>
            <p>I know this is not possible for everyone, but try your best to set your classes to be a later in the day if you have the opportunity to do so. Running in the morning makes it easier as you already did it in the morning so you do not have to go back to it later and you can use the whole day to study and hang out with friends.</p>

            <h2>Sleep 8 hours as much as you can</h2>
            <p>In college, it is hard to always sleep 8 hours but when you are running a marathon you need to sleep as much as possible for your muscles to heal up.</p>
