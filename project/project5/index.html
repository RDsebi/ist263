                <h2>Who am I</h2>
                <p>
                I am Sebastian Rodriguez, student at Syracuse University and as of right now training for my first half marathon. When I first started researching about a half marathon I found a lot of resourceful information on how to train, how to get the right nutrition and more, but the only thing I never found online was how to manage your time while running and being a college student. Being a college student we have many responsibilities like academics, extracurriculars and trying to have a social life and running a marathon is a task that takes a few hours a week. When you start running the longer distances it can take up to two hours in training.

                I decided to create this website to give you the best tips from my personal experience on how to manage your time while training for a half marathon and still being active in your academics and have a balance social life.
