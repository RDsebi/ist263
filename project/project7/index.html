                            <h2>Who am I</h2>
                            <p>
                            I am Sebastian Rodriguez, student at Syracuse University and as of right now training for my first half marathon. When I first started researching about a half marathon I found a lot of resourceful information on how to train, how to get the right nutrition and more, but the only thing I never found online was how to manage your time while running and being a college student. Being a college student we have many responsibilities like academics, extracurriculars and trying to have a social life and running a marathon is a task that takes a few hours a week. When you start running the longer distances it can take up to two hours in training.
