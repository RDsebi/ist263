                            <h2>Who am I</h2>
                            <p>
                                My name is Sebastian Rodriguez and I recently completed my first half marathon on April 16th. As a student at Syracuse University, I faced a unique challenge in trying to balance my training for the half marathon while juggling my academic responsibilities, extracurricular activities, and social life. During my research on how to train for a half marathon, I found plenty of useful information on nutrition, training techniques, and more, but I struggled to find advice on time management.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With a training schedule that could take up to two hours a day, I knew that I needed to find a way to balance my time effectively. As a result, I decided to create a website that would provide others with tips and strategies that I personally used to manage my time effectively while training for a half marathon. My goal is to help other college students find a healthy balance between their academics, social life, and fitness goals.
